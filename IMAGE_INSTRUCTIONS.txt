HOW TO ADD YOUR PROFILE IMAGE
==============================

To add your profile picture to the portfolio website:

1. Prepare your image:
   - Choose a professional photo of yourself
   - Recommended size: 800x800 pixels or larger
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, or WebP

2. Add the image to the project:
   - Rename your image file to "profile.jpg" (or "profile.png")
   - Place it in the "public" folder
   - Location: public/profile.jpg

3. The website will automatically display your image in the About section

4. If you want to use a different filename:
   - Open: src/components/About.jsx
   - Find line: src="/profile.jpg"
   - Change it to: src="/your-image-name.jpg"

Note: If no image is found, a cool animated code placeholder will be shown instead.
